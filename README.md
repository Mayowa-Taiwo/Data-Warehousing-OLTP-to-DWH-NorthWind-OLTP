### IMPLEMENTING AN ENTERPRISE DATA WAREHOUSE USING SSIS

### About Project
 - This project aims to explain the processes involved in building data warehouses for organizations looking to create their first Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), assuming they currently have a data repository that can be used as the data source for the ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) pipelines. The OLTP source used for this project is the Northwind Database, which represents a small company or department within a large organization. This database serves as an example for converting an OLTP Database to an Enterprise Data Warehouse using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)."
